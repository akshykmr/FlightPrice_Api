To build the Flight Price API project in Node.js, you can follow these steps:

Step 1: Set up the project

Create a new directory for your project.
Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the project directory.
Run the following command to initialize a new Node.js project:
csharp
Copy code
npm init -y
Create the main script file, for example, flightPriceAPI.js.
Step 2: Install dependencies

Open a terminal or command prompt in your project directory.
Install the required dependencies using the following command:
Copy code
npm install express axios
Step 3: Write the code
Open the flightPriceAPI.js file in a text editor and write the following code:

javascript
Copy code
const express = require('express');
const axios = require('axios');
const app = express();

app.get('/flightPrices', async (req, res) => {
  try {
    const { source, destination, date } = req.query;

    // Make assumptions for flight API URL and parameters
    const apiUrl = 'https://example-flight-api.com/prices';
    const apiKey = 'your-flight-api-key';

    const response = await axios.get(apiUrl, {
      params: {
        source,
        destination,
        date,
        apiKey,
      },
    });

    res.json(response.data);
  } catch (error) {
    res.status(500).json({ error: 'An error occurred' });
  }
});

// Start the server
const port = process.env.PORT || 3000;
app.listen(port, () => {
  console.log(`Server is listening on port ${port}`);
});
Step 4: Run the server
Save the flightPriceAPI.js file and run the following command in the terminal or command prompt:

Copy code
node flightPriceAPI.js
The server will start running, and you can access the flight prices by making a GET request to http://localhost:3000/flightPrices with the required parameters: source, destination, and date.

Example: http://localhost:3000/flightPrices?source=Delhi&destination=Jaipur&date=15%20April%202023

The server will respond with flight prices in JSON format.

Step 5: Host the project on GitHub

Create a new repository on GitHub.
Follow the instructions to add the remote repository and push your code.
Step 6: Host the project on a platform (optional)
If you want to host your Node.js application, you can use platforms like Heroku, Netlify, or Vercel. Follow their documentation to deploy your application.

Step 7: Submit the assignment
Fill out the application form provided and submit the GitHub repository link and the hosted website link (if applicable).

That's it! You have built a Flight Price API project using Node.js. Remember to implement any additional requirements mentioned in the assignment, such as a React frontend, authentication, or TypeScript, if you choose to include them.

Note: Make sure to replace the placeholder URLs, API keys, and error handling with appropriate values and implementation suitable for your use case.

If you want to implement additional requirements mentioned in the assignment, such as a React frontend, authentication, or TypeScript, here are some guidelines:

React Frontend:

Create a separate directory for your frontend code within your project.
Set up a new React application using a tool like Create React App.
Implement a user interface that allows users to input the source, destination, and date, and display the flight prices returned from the backend API.
Use the fetch or axios library to make requests to the backend API from your React components.
Update the flightPriceAPI.js file to handle CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) to allow requests from the frontend.
Build the React frontend using npm run build and serve the static files using Express in your backend.
Authentication:

Implement an authentication system to secure access to your flight price API.
You can use a library like Passport.js or implement your own authentication middleware.
Require users to authenticate before accessing the flight price data.
You can use session-based authentication or JWT (JSON Web Tokens) for stateless authentication.
Update the API endpoints to check for authentication before returning flight prices.
TypeScript:

If you want to use TypeScript, rename the backend script file to flightPriceAPI.ts.
Install the necessary TypeScript dependencies using npm install --save-dev typescript ts-node.
Create a tsconfig.json file in your project directory with the necessary TypeScript compiler options.
Rewrite the code in the flightPriceAPI.ts file using TypeScript syntax, including type annotations for variables and functions.
Run the TypeScript code using ts-node or compile it to JavaScript using tsc and then run the JavaScript output file.
Remember to replace the placeholder URLs, API keys, and error handling in both the frontend and backend code with appropriate values and implementation suitable for your use case.

Once you have implemented the additional requirements, make sure to update the GitHub repository and the hosted website link (if applicable) in the assignment submission.

what does recruiter means by this line "Make assumptions whenever necessary" in above task
ChatGPT
When the recruiter mentions "Make assumptions whenever necessary" in the task description, it means that you are allowed to make reasonable assumptions or decisions in situations where specific details or requirements are not explicitly provided.

In the context of the Flight Price API project, here are a few examples of assumptions you might need to make:

Input Validation: If the task doesn't specify how to validate user input for the source, destination, and date, you can assume that basic validation is sufficient. For example, you can assume that the source and destination are valid city names or IATA codes, and the date is in a valid format.

Flight API Integration: If the task doesn't provide a specific flight API to use, you can assume that you are free to choose any flight API of your choice. You can assume the existence of an API that provides flight prices based on the source, destination, and date parameters.

Error Handling: If the task doesn't specify how to handle errors, you can assume that returning a generic error message with an appropriate HTTP status code (e.g., 500 for internal server errors) is sufficient.

Response Format: If the task doesn't specify the exact format of the flight price response, you can assume that returning a JSON object with flight providers as keys and corresponding prices as values, as shown in the example output, is acceptable.

Remember to document any assumptions you make in your project documentation or comments, so that it is clear why certain decisions were made during the development process.

It's always a good practice to clarify any ambiguities or assumptions with the recruiter or project stakeholder if possible, to ensure that your implementation aligns with their expectations.
